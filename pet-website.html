  <h1>My Animals:</h1>
    <h2>Stout the old man</h2>
      <p>Stout is a 10 yearold English Bulldog who truly only 
         loves his mom. We rescued stout when he was 3 years 
         old, he was not in the best shape. Since then him and
         and my mom have become as close as a person can be 
         with their fury friend.

    <h2>Jolene the rookie</h2>
      <p>Jolene is a 6 month old Staffordshire-Bullterrier. She
         is my puppy and I got her when she was 7 weeks old, a
         true rookie. She's my bestfriend, sadly she does not 
         live in SF with me due to that I am just a little to
         busy.
