  <h1>My Animals:</h1>
    <h2>Stout the old man</h2>
      <p>Stout is a 10 yearold English Bulldog who truly only 
         loves his mom. We rescued stout when he was 3 years 
         old, he was not in the best shape. Since then him and
         and my mom have become as close as a person can be 
         with their fury friend.
      </p>
    <h2>Jolene the rookie</h2>
      <p>Jolene is a 6 month old Staffordshire-Bullterrier. She
         is my puppy and I got her when she was 7 weeks old, a
         true rookie. She's my bestfriend, sadly she does not 
         live in SF with me due to that I am just a little to
         busy. Jolene is at home with my mom who I think loves
         my dod more than me!
      </p>
    <h2>Favorite Toys/Activites</h2>
      <p>Before we get started on a little list, I wouldn't say Stout is a big player.</p>
        <h3>TOYSSS</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Both really love a good ol' fashion bone (Stout doesn't let Jolene have his).</li>
            <li>Stout loves rubber balls because he can't destroy them!</li>
            <li>Jolene on the other hand loves fabric balls cause she rips them to shreds</li>
            <li>Squeaky toys of course.</li>
